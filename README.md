## Overview

This is a frontendmentor Tic-Tac-Toe project challenge that I took to practice my frontend skills and improve on areas of weekness.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

- Framer Motion

### What I learned

Working through this project was challenging and fun at the same time (when the code works). there had been days when I can't do much because of some errors that I faced or the feature was hard to implement but always the come back was always better than the first approach.
In this project I learned one new thing though I have been putting it off for some time, that's Web animation, I learned how to add some basic animation using Framer motion and I loved it, from now on I will be adding animations to all my projects whenever necessary, also building this project helped me reinforce the concepts I already knew and the ones I just learned. It was a fun time building this App and I can't wait to build another one. Thanks for your time reader.
